# Movie Recommendation System

The Movie Recommendation System operates on a content-based approach through a Streamlit web interface, utilizing data sourced from The Movie Database (TMDb). This system functions by selecting a movie and determining similar movies based on features. It displays a list of five recommended movies that closely align with the chosen film. Each recommendation includes a dynamically fetched movie poster from TMDb's API.
